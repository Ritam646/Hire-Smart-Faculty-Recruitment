# Hire-Smart-Faculty-Recruitment

The problem it solves
Manual faculty recruitment in educational institutions is often time-consuming, subjective, and prone to unconscious bias. HR teams and department heads spend hours manually reviewing hundreds of resumes, shortlisting candidates based on inconsistent criteria, and crafting interview questions — all while risking overlooking qualified applicants or favoring certain profiles unfairly.
Hire Smart: Faculty Recruitment Manager solves this by automating the entire screening and evaluation process with AI, making it:

Faster – Reduces screening time from days to seconds per resume
Fairer – Uses data-driven scoring with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to evaluate candidates against objective job requirements, minimizing human bias
More consistent – Applies the same evaluation framework to every applicant
Smarter – Automatically generates tailored, role-specific interview questions based on the candidate’s experience and the department’s needs
